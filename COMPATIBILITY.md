## Deeply Integrated Mods

### Real Vehicle Breakdowns (RVB)
**Author:** MathiasHun

**Status:** DEEPLY INTEGRATED (v2.1.0+)

**What it does:** Comprehensive vehicle breakdown simulation tracking 10+ parts with operating hours and failure states.

**How UsedPlus integrates:**

#### DNA System Integration (v2.6.0+)
- **Legendary Immunity** - Vehicles with DNA 0.90+ are IMMUNE to RVB repair degradation
- **Workhorse Bonus** - DNA 0.70-0.89 vehicles experience reduced part wear
- **Lemon Penalty** - DNA 0.00-0.29 vehicles degrade faster through RVB

#### Symptoms Before Failure Philosophy
- **UsedPlus = Journey** - Gradual symptoms warn players BEFORE catastrophic failure
- **RVB = Destination** - Final catastrophic failure when parts exhausted
- **Reliability Derivation** - UsedPlus reads RVB part health to calculate symptom severity

#### Workshop Dialog Integration (v2.1.0+)
- **Unified Workshop Experience** - When RVB is installed, UsedPlus hides its own Inspect button (RVB replaces it with their Workshop button)
- **Data Injection** - UsedPlus injects its unique data into RVB's Workshop Dialog left pane:
  - "— UsedPlus —" section divider
  - Hydraulic System: XX% (unique - RVB doesn't track hydraulics)
  - Maintenance Grade: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor/Critical
  - Service History: X repairs, Y breakdowns (if notable)
- **Visual Consistency** - Uses RVB's row templates for matching fonts and colors

#### OBD Scanner Enhancement (v2.0.0+)
- **Activation Prompt** - Shows "Use OBD Scanner - Tractor (RVB)" when RVB issues detected
- **Part Status Display** - Shows individual RVB part statuses:
  - Engine, Thermostat (engine system)
  - Generator, Battery, Starter, Glow Plug (electrical system)
- **Fault Indicators** - Parts showing "FAULT" (red) or "!" prefault warning (orange)
- **Fault Counter** - Total number of active faults across all RVB parts

#### OBD Scanner Multi-Mode (v2.7.0+)
- **RVB System Analysis Mode** - Dedicated mode for detailed RVB part inspection
- **Only visible when RVB installed** - Mode button hidden entirely without RVB

#### Holistic Used Vehicle Inspection (v2.1.0+)
- **Pre-Generated Part Data** - When agent finds used vehicle, RVB-compatible parts are generated:
  - Engine, Thermostat, Generator, Battery, Starter, Glow Plug
  - Each part has "life" percentage based on vehicle condition with realistic variance
- **Inspection Report Display** - Shows "COMPONENT STATUS" section with 6 parts in 3 columns
- **Purchase Initialization** - When player buys, RVB operating hours match inspection data
- **Deferred Sync** - If player buys without RVB then later installs it, data auto-syncs

#### Service Button Integration (v2.5.1+)
When player uses RVB's "Service" button:
- RVB's original service runs (resets RVB part wear)
- **UsedPlus fluids topped up** - Oil and hydraulic fluid restored to 100%
- **Minor leaks fixed** - Oil/hydraulic leak states cleared
- **Small reliability boost** - +3% hydraulic, +1.5% engine reliability

**Feature Responsibility Table:**
| Feature | Who Handles It |
|---------|---------------|
| Progressive speed limiting | UsedPlus (uses RVB engine health) |
| First-start stalling | UsedPlus (uses RVB engine health) |
| Hydraulic drift | UsedPlus only (unique feature) |
| Steering pull | UsedPlus only (unique feature) |
| Runaway Engine | UsedPlus (requires low oil + hydraulic) |
| Implement Stuck/Pull/Drag | UsedPlus |
| Final engine failure | RVB (7 km/h cap when part exhausted) |
| Final electrical failure | RVB (lights/starter fail) |
| Flat tire trigger | RVB (via UYT integration) |
| Workshop Inspect button | RVB (UsedPlus hides its button) |
| RVB Service button | RVB + UsedPlus fluids |
| RVB Repair button | Opens UsedPlus RepairDialog |
| RVB Workshop vehicle info | UsedPlus injects |
| OBD Part Detail Display | UsedPlus |
| OBD RVB Analysis Mode | UsedPlus (v2.7.0+) |

### Use Up Your Tyres (UYT)
**Author:** 50keda

**Status:** DEEPLY INTEGRATED (v2.3.0+)

**What it does:** Distance-based tire wear system with visual progression and friction reduction.

#### Two-Way Sync (v2.3.0+)
- **UsedPlus → UYT** - TiresDialog replacement resets UYT's distance tracking
- **UYT → UsedPlus** - UsedPlus reads UYT wear data for condition displays

#### Quality Affects UYT Wear Rate
| Tier | Cost | Traction | Wear Rate | Initial State | Effective Life |
|------|------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Retread | 40% | 85% | 2x faster | +35% worn | ~32% of Normal |
| Normal | 100% | 100% | 1x | Fresh | 100% baseline |
| Quality | 150% | 110% | 0.67x | -15% bonus | ~172% of Normal |

*5x life difference between cheapest and best options!*

#### DNA Affects UYT Wear Rate
- Lemons (low DNA): 1.4x wear rate (harder on tires)
- Workhorses (high DNA): 0.6x wear rate (gentler driving)

#### UYT Wear Influences Flat Probability
- 0% UYT wear: 1x flat chance (baseline)
- 100% UYT wear: 3x flat chance (worn tires more likely to fail)
- Note: UYT itself has no flat tires - UsedPlus adds this as a complementary feature

#### Per-Wheel Display
When UYT installed, TiresDialog shows:
- FL/FR/RL/RR individual conditions
- "Worst" tire indicator
- Condition label changes to "Tire Wear (UYT):"

#### OBD Scanner Enhancement (v2.0.0+)
- **Activation Prompt** - Shows "Use OBD Scanner - Tractor (Tires)" when >80% tire wear
- **Tire Wear Display** - Shows FL, FR, RL, RR conditions
- **Worst Indicator** - Highlights the most worn tire

#### OBD Scanner Tire Service Mode (v2.7.0+)
- **Dedicated mode** for tire inspection and service
- Per-wheel condition display with service options

#### Holistic Used Vehicle Inspection (v2.1.0+)
- **Pre-Generated Tire Data** - FL, FR, RL, RR conditions generated for used vehicles
- **Front Tire Bias** - Front tires generated with higher wear (simulates steering wear)
- **Purchase Initialization** - UYT wheel wear matches inspection data after purchase
- **Deferred Sync** - Auto-syncs if UYT installed later

**Feature Responsibility Table:**
| Feature | Who Handles It |
|---------|---------------|
| Tire wear calculation | Both: UYT (distance) + UsedPlus (quality/DNA multipliers) |
| Visual tire degradation | UYT (shader-based) |
| Tire condition display | UsedPlus (synced from UYT) |
| Flat tire trigger | UsedPlus (UYT doesn't have flats) |
| Low traction warning | UsedPlus |
| Tire replacement (shop) | UYT (workshop button) |
| Tire replacement (UsedPlus) | UsedPlus (syncs to UYT) |
| TiresDialog per-wheel display | UsedPlus |
| Quality wear multiplier | UsedPlus |
| DNA wear multiplier | UsedPlus |
| OBD Tire Detail Display | UsedPlus |
| OBD Tire Service Mode | UsedPlus (v2.7.0+) |

## Integrated Mods (Feature Deferral)

These mods are fully compatible with UsedPlus automatically deferring specific features to avoid conflicts.

### EnhancedLoanSystem (ELS)

**Status:** INTEGRATED (v1.8.2+)

| Credit scoring | Both (independent) |

---

### BuyUsedEquipment (BUE)

**Status:** COMPATIBLE (v1.8.1+)

**What it does:** Broker-based used equipment search where players pay a fee, wait for success rolls, and find vehicles in the vanilla shop's Sales tab.

- **Detection:** `BuyUsedEquipment ~= nil`
- **Search Used button** - Hidden from shop when BUE detected
- **UsedVehicleManager** - Still initializes (for agent-based selling)

- Lease payments (UsedPlus + HP)
- Worker wages (Employment)

---

## Not Recommended

### AdvancedMaintenance (AM)

**Status:** NOT RECOMMENDED

**What it does:** Prevents engine start at 0% damage and causes random shutdowns when damage exceeds 28%.

**Why it's not recommended:**
- Both mods track vehicle condition independently
- Can cause inconsistent behavior where UsedPlus shows one state, AM shows another
- Maintenance features overlap significantly
- **Recommendation:** Use one or the other, not both
