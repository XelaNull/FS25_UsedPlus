**Design Principle: Icons Add Polish, Not Clutter**
- **Small confirmation dialogs** (620px): Header icon ONLY (centered above title)
- **Large input dialogs** (720-820px): Section icons ONLY (no header icon)

| Dialog Type | Example | Icons |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Small Confirmation | LoanApprovedDialog, SearchInitiatedDialog, SaleListingInitiatedDialog | Header icon only |
| Large Input | UsedSearchDialog, UnifiedPurchaseDialog, InspectionReportDialog, DealDetailsDialog, NegotiationDialog | Section icons only |

**Technical Implementation:**
- 33 icons stored in `gui/icons/` folder (256x256 PNG)
- Generated via `tools/generateIcons.js` using Sharp library
- Set dynamically via Lua `setImageFilename()` (XML paths don't work in ZIP mods)
- XML profiles use `baseReference` + `noSlice` + square size pattern

### Added - Admin Control Panel

**New Feature: upAdminCP Console Command**
- Comprehensive in-game admin/testing panel accessible via `upAdminCP` console command
- Requires admin privileges and must be in a vehicle to open
- 5 organized tabs with 60+ one-click test buttons:

| Tab | Features |
|-----|----------|
| **Malfunctions** | Trigger stall, misfire, overheat, runaway, seizure, cutout, surge, flat tires |
| **Spawning** | Spawn OBD Scanner, Service Truck, Parts Pallet; trigger/reset discovery |
| **Finance** | Add money ($10k/$100k/$1M), set credit scores (300-850), create test loans |
| **Dialogs** | Direct access to all 15+ dialogs for testing (bypasses normal flow) |
| **State** | Toggle debug mode, set reliability (10%/50%/100%), manipulate hours, set seller DNA |

- Status bar shows feedback after each action
- Vehicle condition painting: Pristine, Worn, Beaten, Destroyed presets
- Quick vehicle swap: Next/Prev vehicle buttons for rapid testing

### Added - Language Expansion

**5 New Languages (15 Total)**
- Dutch (NL)
- Hungarian (HU)
- Turkish (TR)
- Portuguese - Portugal (PT)
- Japanese (JP)

Full translation of all 1,944 localization keys for each new language.

### Improved - Documentation & Community

## [2.9.1] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed - Negotiation System Bug Fixes

**Bug 1: Walkaway listing removal was failing**
- `removeListingPermanently` showed "missing listing or search" errors
- Root cause: `self.listing` and `self.search` were nil by the time removal ran
- Fix: Cache listing/search values BEFORE any operations, pass explicitly to new `removeListingPermanentlyWithData()` method

**Bug 2: Reject response had no consequence - exploit allowed**
- Players could get rejected, hit Esc, and immediately retry with higher offer
- Root cause: REJECT responses didn't apply any cooldown
- Fix: Walking away (or Esc) from a REJECT response now applies 30-minute cooldown
- Added `purchaseCompleted` flag to prevent cooldown when player pays full price

**Bug 3: False "saved $X" at 100% offer**
- Paying full price showed "You saved $44" due to rounding
- Root cause: Offer amounts were rounded to nearest $100 even at 100%
- Example: $44,544 asking → 100% offer = $44,500 → "$44 saved"
- Fix: At 100%, use exact asking price with no rounding

**Bug 4: Cashback not reducing "Due Today" display**
- Setting $10k cashback still showed $20k due today
- Root cause: Display calculated `dueTodayAmount = downPayment` ignoring cashback
- Fix: `dueTodayAmount = downPayment - cashBack`

**Bug 5: Affordability check ignored cashback**
- Could be blocked from financing even when cashback made it affordable
- Root cause: Checked `downPayment > farm.money` instead of `(downPayment - cashBack) > farm.money`
- Fix: Use net due today for affordability check and success notification

**Bug 6: Inspection tiers showed identical reports**
- Quick, Standard, and Comprehensive inspections all showed the same full detail
- Root cause: `InspectionReportDialog` never checked `revealLevel` from tier config
- Fix: Implemented tier-based visibility filtering:
  - **Quick (revealLevel 1)**: Overall rating + recommendation ONLY
  - **Standard (revealLevel 2)**: + Component reliabilities, fluid assessment, RVB parts, tire conditions
  - **Comprehensive (revealLevel 3)**: + Mechanic quote (DNA hint), repair cost estimate, post-repair value

**Bug 7: RVB components shown without RVB installed**
- Engine Core, Thermostat, Battery, etc. were visible even without RVB mod
- Root cause: We generate synthetic RVB data for all listings, but didn't check if RVB was installed before displaying
- Fix: Added `ModCompatibility.rvbInstalled` check to `displayIntegratedRVBData()` - now only shows when RVB mod is present

**Bug 8: Confirmation dialog still showed full down payment when cashback used**
- First popup (Purchase Vehicle) showed correct $10k, but confirmation dialog still showed $20k
- Root cause: `buildConfirmationMessage()` showed raw `downPayment` without subtracting `cashBack`
- Fix: Calculate `netDueToday = downPayment - cashBack` and show breakdown when cashback > 0

**Bug 9: Finance purchase failed silently - "attempt to call nil value"**
- Clicking confirm on financed purchase did nothing, returned to previous screen
- Root cause: `FinanceEvents.lua:159` called nonexistent `CreditScore.getScore(farmId)`
- Fix: Changed to `CreditScore.calculate(farmId)` (the correct function name)

**Bug 10: CreditReportDialog and TakeLoanDialog failed to load from ZIP**
- Error: "Failed to open xml file" when trying to open these dialogs
- Root cause: Non-ASCII Unicode characters in XML files break FS25's XML parser
  - CreditReportDialog.xml had `±` in a comment
  - TakeLoanDialog.xml had `☐` (Unicode checkbox) characters
- Fix: Replaced all non-ASCII characters with ASCII equivalents:
  - `±190px` → `-190px to +190px`
  - `☐` → `[ ]`
  - `×` → `x`

**Bug 11: Land/Vehicle lease and finance events crashed in single player**
- Error: "attempt to call missing method 'getServerConnection' of table"
- Root cause: `g_server:getServerConnection()` is invalid - `g_server` doesn't have that method
- Affected 8 places across 3 files: LandEvents.lua, FinanceEvents.lua, LeaseEvents.lua
- Fix: Changed to `event:run(nil)` when running on server (no connection needed)

**Bug 12: Events crashed when connection is nil after Bug 11 fix**
- Error: "attempt to index nil with 'getIsServer'"
- Root cause: After passing `nil` for connection, `connection:getIsServer()` fails
- Affected 26 places across 8 event files
- Fix: Changed all checks to `if connection ~= nil and not connection:getIsServer() then`

**Bug 13: Savegame failed to load - DealUtils.generateId nil farmId**
- Error: "invalid argument #3 to 'format' (number expected, got nil)"
- Root cause: `DealUtils.generateId()` called with nil farmId during savegame load
- Fix: Added nil guard `local safeFarmId = farmId or 0`

**Bug 14: Savegame failed to load - nil arithmetic in Deal constructors**
- Error: "attempt to perform arithmetic (sub) on nil" in FinanceDeal.lua
- Root cause: Deal constructors called with nil price/termMonths/interestRate during load
- Fix: Added nil guards to all numeric parameters in FinanceDeal, LeaseDeal, LandLeaseDeal

**Additional Fixes:**
- Fixed Service Truck XML: `</component>` → `</components>` tag mismatch on line 47
- Fixed MaintenanceTires.lua: `getSnowHeight()` method doesn't exist, use `snowDepth` property or season check instead

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added - Service Truck System
A driveable service truck that performs **long-term vehicle restoration**, including the unique ability to restore the reliability ceiling that degrades on lemons.

**IMPORTANT: Discovery System**
The Service Truck is NOT available in the shop! It must be **discovered** through National Agent transactions:

**Prerequisites (ALL required):**
- 3+ OBD Scanner uses (you understand the basic repair system)
- 700+ credit score (you're a serious customer)
- Own a vehicle with reliability ceiling < 90% (you've felt the pain)

**Discovery Flow:**
1. Complete any National Agent transaction (buy or sell)
2. If prerequisites met: 20% chance agent mentions "a connection"
3. Special opportunity dialog shows: retiring mechanic's service truck
4. **CASH ONLY** - $67,500 (10% connection discount)
5. Accept now or decline (saved to Finance Manager for 30 days)
6. Pity timer: guaranteed discovery after 10 eligible transactions

**Why Gated?**
- Players must EARN the endgame tool
- Prevents trivializing the ceiling degradation mechanic
- Creates a meaningful "aha!" moment when discovered
- Triple gate: skill (OBD uses) + credit (700+) + wealth ($67,500 cash)

**New Files:**
- `vehicles/ServiceTruck.lua` - Main specialization (~750 lines)
- `vehicles/serviceTruck/serviceTruck.xml` - Vehicle definition (hidden from shop)
- `vehicles/sparePartsPallet/sparePartsPallet.xml` - Purchasable spare parts pallet ($500)
- `src/data/RestorationData.lua` - Diagnostic scenarios and restoration parameters
- `src/gui/ServiceTruckDialog.lua` - Inspection minigame and status dialog
- `src/gui/ServiceTruckDiscoveryDialog.lua` - Discovery opportunity popup
- `gui/ServiceTruckDialog.xml` - Dialog UI definition
- `gui/ServiceTruckDiscoveryDialog.xml` - Discovery popup UI
- `src/events/RestorationEvents.lua` - Restoration multiplayer sync
- `src/events/ServiceTruckDiscoveryEvent.lua` - Discovery/purchase MP sync
- `src/managers/ServiceTruckDiscovery.lua` - Discovery prerequisites and state tracking
- `data/fillTypes.xml` - Custom USEDPLUS_SPAREPARTS fill type

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ceiling Restoration** | Only way to restore degraded reliability ceiling (unique!) |
| **Long-term Process** | 1% reliability per game hour, 0.25% ceiling per hour |
| **Resource Consumption** | Diesel (5L/hr), Oil (0.5L/hr), Hydraulic (0.5L/hr), Spare Parts (2/hr) |
| **Target Immobilization** | Vehicle wheels hidden, engine locked during restoration |
| **Inspection Minigame** | Pass diagnostic quiz to start restoration |
| **48-Hour Cooldown** | Failed inspection = 48 game-hour cooldown per component |
| **Full Multiplayer** | Server-authoritative with progress sync events |

**Service Truck vs OBD Scanner:**
| Aspect | OBD Scanner | Service Truck |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Item Type | Hand tool ($5,000) | Driveable vehicle ($67,500-$75,000) |
| Availability | Always in shop | **Must be discovered** |
| Duration | Instant | Hours/days |
| Max Restoration | 80% cap | 100% possible |
| Ceiling Repair | No | **YES** |
| Payment | Cash/Finance/Lease | **CASH ONLY** |

**Spare Parts System:**
- Buy spare parts pallets from shop ($500 for 100 parts)
- Place within 5m of service truck
- Truck auto-consumes 2 parts per game hour
- No parts = work pauses (no damage, just stopped)

**Credits:**
- Vehicle model: **Canada FS** (GMC C7000 Service 81-89 v1.0)

### Changed
- `modDesc.xml` - Added fill types, ServiceTruck specialization, vehicle type, store items
- `UsedPlusMaintenance.lua` - Added restoration state tracking (isBeingRestored, cooldowns)
- `VehicleSpawning.lua` - Hook for National Agent purchase discovery trigger
- `VehicleSaleManager.lua` - Hook for National Agent sale discovery trigger
- `main.lua` - Save/load hooks for ServiceTruckDiscovery state

## [2.8.0] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed - Multiplayer Synchronization (GitHub Issue #1 Part 3)
Complete audit and fix of all actions that bypassed network events. Previously, many operations worked in single-player but silently failed on dedicated servers because they called managers directly instead of using network events.

**New Network Events Created:**
- `PurchaseUsedVehicleEvent` - Used vehicle purchases from agent search results
- `TradeInVehicleEvent` - Trade-in vehicle deletion with proper credit
- `PurchaseLandCashEvent` - Land cash purchases with ownership transfer
- `VanillaLoanPaymentEvent` - Vanilla farm.loan payments
- `MaintenanceEvents.lua` (new file):
  - `FieldRepairEvent` - Field service kit seizure repairs
  - `RefillFluidsEvent` - Oil/hydraulic fluid refills
  - `ReplaceTiresEvent` - Tire replacement with quality tiers

**Dialogs Fixed:**
- `VehiclePortfolioDialog` - Used vehicle purchase now uses `PurchaseUsedVehicleEvent`
- `UnifiedLandPurchaseDialog` - Cash/Finance/Lease land purchases now use proper events
- `UnifiedPurchaseDialog` - Trade-in now uses `TradeInVehicleEvent`
- `DealDetailsDialog` - Early payoff now uses `FinancePaymentEvent`
- `FieldServiceKitDialog` - Seizure repairs now use `FieldRepairEvent`
- `FluidsDialog` - Fluid refills now use `RefillFluidsEvent`
- `TiresDialog` - Tire replacement now uses `ReplaceTiresEvent`
- `FinancesPanel` - Vanilla loan payment now uses `VanillaLoanPaymentEvent`

**Extensions Fixed:**
- `InGameMenuVehiclesFrameExtension` - Sale listing creation uses `CreateSaleListingEvent`
- `VehicleSellingPointExtension` - Sale listing creation uses `CreateSaleListingEvent`

**Enhanced Existing Events:**
- `CreateSaleListingEvent` - Now supports dual-tier system (agentTier + priceTier)
- `LandLeaseEvent` - Now accepts termMonths, securityDeposit, monthlyPayment parameters
- `ReplaceTiresEvent` - Now handles quality tiers (1-3) and includes flat tire repair

**Result:** Server is now authoritative for all financial transactions. Clients receive proper success/failure feedback via `TransactionResponseEvent`.

### Fixed - Other
- **Inspection Report showing RVB components when disabled** - Generator, Starter, Battery, Glow Plug were shown even with RVB integration disabled
  - Root cause: `displayIntegratedRVBData()` only checked if listing had RVB data, not if setting was enabled
  - Fix: Added `enableRVBIntegration` setting check before displaying sub-components
- **Duplicate lease end dialogs** - When a lease term completed, TWO dialogs would show
  - `LeaseDeal:completeLease()` showed `LeaseEndDialog` (2 options: Return/Buyout)
  - `FinanceManager` also showed `LeaseRenewalDialog` (3 options: Return/Buyout/Renew)
  - Fix: Removed dialog call from `completeLease()` - now only `LeaseRenewalDialog` shows with all 3 options
  - Note: `LeaseEndDialog.lua` is now deprecated (kept for backwards compatibility but not used)

### Added
- **Malfunction Frequency slider** - New setting to adjust how often malfunctions occur
  - Range: 25% to 200% (default 100%)
  - 25% = very rare malfunctions, 200% = twice as frequent
  - Located in Settings menu right after Malfunctions toggle
  - Presets automatically set appropriate values (Easy: 25%, Challenging: 125%, Hardcore: 200%)
- **Persistence debugging** - WARN-level logging throughout save/load flow
  - Logs when FSBaseMission.loadItemsFinished hook fires with missionInfo status
  - Logs when loadSavegameData is called with savegame directory
  - Logs each search registration with count
  - Logs save/load completion with counts
  - Helps diagnose "searches disappear after save/load" issues

### Changed
- **Farm.new hook** - Now checks if data arrays already exist before initializing
  - Prevents accidental overwriting of loaded search/listing data
  - Logs warning if farm already has searches (indicates unexpected call order)

### Fixed
- **OBD Scanner reliability exploit** - Players could spam OBD kits to restore reliability to 100%
  - **One-time diagnosis per system**: Each component (engine, electrical, hydraulic) can only receive ONE diagnostic boost from OBD Scanner
  - **80% cap**: OBD field repair cannot restore above 80% (shop repair needed for higher)
  - **Respects vehicle ceiling**: Also capped by vehicle's `maxReliabilityCeiling` (aging/wear ceiling)
  - **Effective cap**: min(80%, vehicleCeiling)
  - **Seizure repair is separate**: Fixing a seized component does NOT use up the diagnostic boost - it's emergency repair
  - Seizure repair also respects vehicle ceiling
  - Tracking persists across save/load and syncs in multiplayer
- **Buyer Found popup "Keep Waiting" truncation** - Button text was cut off with "..."
  - Created custom `soKeepWaitingBtn` profile with wider size and `textTruncation="false"`
- **Workshop shows sold vehicle** - Workshop still displayed vehicle after accepting sale offer
  - Added `closeWorkshopIfShowingVehicle()` to close workshop/shop config screen before deleting sold vehicle
  - Checks `g_shopConfigScreen`, `g_workshopScreen`, and `inGameMenu.pageVehicles`
- **OBD Scanner UI improvements** - Multiple visual and UX enhancements:
  - **Diagnose Component**: Removed reliability % display from system buttons (player must diagnose from hints - showing percentages defeated the puzzle)
  - **Scanner Readout**: Enhanced terminal appearance with larger text (13px), better padding, and green diagnostic color scheme
  - **Tire Service vehicle image**: Fixed stretched appearance - now uses proper 140x140 square format with `noSlice`
  - **Tire Service layout**: Reorganized with vehicle centered above 2x2 tire grid for better visual flow
- **OBD Scanner messaging** - Corrected confusing/inaccurate result screen text:
  - Changed "TEMPORARY REPAIR - visit workshop for permanent fix" → "FIELD SERVICE COMPLETE"
  - OBD fixes **reliability** (malfunction chance), workshop fixes **damage** - these are different systems!
  - Updated "kit consumed" message: "Field-serviceable adjustments have been made to this system"
  - Now states "Further diagnostics on this system require workshop equipment"
- **Mechanical repair not working** - Cash payment confirmation showed "Configuration changed" but vehicle wasn't repaired and money wasn't deducted
  - Root cause: Security validation added in v2.7.2 checked for nil values BEFORE default values were applied
  - Optional parameters (`termMonths`, `monthlyPayment`, `downPayment`) are not passed for cash payments
  - Validation saw nil → returned early → skipped both money deduction AND repair
  - Fix: Moved default value assignments to top of execute() function, before validation
- **Oil Service Tank fluid type selection** - Always purchased oil regardless of selecting Hydraulic Fluid
  - Root cause: MultiTextOption callback was missing from XML
  - Fix: Added `onClick="onFluidTypeChanged"` to FluidPurchaseDialog.xml
- **Used vehicle age/hours realism** - Vehicle age is now correlated with operating hours
  - Previously a 3800-hour vehicle could be only 1-2 years old (unrealistic!)
  - Now calculates minimum age from hours (assumes 400-1000 hours/year usage)
  - Vehicle age is actually APPLIED to spawned vehicles (was missing before!)
  - FS25 stores age in months, listing age in years - now converts properly
- **EnhancedLoanSystem (ELS) integration** - ELS loans now display correctly on UsedPlus Finance page
  - Added late-binding detection: checks for `g_els_loanManager` at runtime, not just during init
  - ELS converts vanilla loans in `onStartMission()` which runs after our init
  - Finance panel now checks directly for ELS global, bypassing init-time flag
  - Added robust method checking using `type()` instead of field lookup
  - Wrapped ELS API calls in pcall for error handling
  - Fixed interest rate conversion (ELS stores as %, we convert to decimal)
  - Better loan naming: shows original loan amount in Finance list
  - Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### Changed
- **ELS detection** - Enhanced to check multiple ELS globals (g_els_loanManager, ELS_loanManager class, ELS_loan class)
- **VehiclePortfolioDialog exploit prevention** - Now closes any open VehiclePortfolioDialog when SearchExpiredDialog opens
  - Prevents player from keeping "Found Vehicles" popup open after search expires to continue inspecting/buying
- **Seller walkaway exploit fix** - When seller walks away insulted, ALL related dialogs now close
  - Closes NegotiationDialog, InspectionReportDialog, UsedVehiclePreviewDialog, and VehiclePortfolioDialog
  - Prevents player from making another offer after seller has walked away
  - Listing is permanently removed so it cannot be offered on again

### Technical
- Added debug logging throughout ELS integration path for easier troubleshooting
- Late-binding pattern allows detection even if mods load in unexpected order

  - Fixed maxOffset calculation: changed from scrolling style to paging style
  - Next button now properly disables on last page
- **Inspection complete popup timing** - Dialog now shows "Complete" instead of "In Progress"
  - Added 2-frame delay before opening preview dialog from completion notification
  - Ensures YesNoDialog fully closes before new dialog opens
- **View Report button not opening inspection report** - Fixed dialog instance mismatch
  - Changed from getInstance() pattern to DialogLoader.show() for consistency
  - Fixes both UsedVehiclePreviewDialog → InspectionReportDialog and Go Back navigation
- **RVB Workshop Mechanic's Assessment** - Text no longer truncated
  - Expanded label to 95% container width with centered alignment

- **RVB Workshop Repaint button** - Now properly opens Repaint dialog
  - Fixed g_soundPlayer:playSample() API call (doesn't exist)
  - Wrapped in pcall with g_gui:playSample() fallback
- **Currency formatting consistency** - $ now always appears before amount
  - New UIHelper.Text.formatMoney() uses American format ($X,XXX) throughout mod

### Changed
- **UsedSearchDialog** - "Match Quality" label renamed to "Chance to Match Quality"
  - Removed confusing "(+8%)" modifier display from success rate
  - Dialog height reduced from 755px to 740px
- **UsedVehiclePreviewDialog** - Cancel button now shows "Close" when inspection is in progress/complete

---

## [2.7.2] - 2026-01-18

### Security Hardening (Multiplayer) - OWASP Compliance Update
- **NetworkSecurity utility** - New centralized security validation module
  - `validateFarmOwnership(connection, farmId)` - Verify player owns the farm they claim
  - `hasMasterRights(connection)` - Check for admin permissions
  - `logSecurityEvent(eventType, details, connection)` - Audit trail for security events

- **Farm ownership verification on ALL network events** - Prevents multiplayer exploits
  - FinanceVehicleEvent, FinancePaymentEvent, TakeLoanEvent

  - LeaseVehicleEvent: configCount limited to 100 max
  - TakeLoanEvent: collateralCount limited to 50 max
  - UsedPlusSettingsEvent: settingCount limited to 200 max
  - Prevents server freeze from malicious clients sending billions of iterations

- **Financial parameter validation** - Prevents money generation exploits
  - All monetary amounts validated for NaN/Infinity and reasonable bounds
  - CashBack validated against credit-based maximum
  - Interest rates validated 0-50% range
  - Loan amounts validated against collateral value (max 150%)
  - Negative amounts rejected to prevent reversed money flow

- **Input sanitization** - Lua table injection prevention
  - Configuration keys validated to reject `__metatable`, `__index` etc.
  - Enum values validated before conditional deserialization (LeaseRenewalEvent)
  - Percentage values clamped to 0-1 range (RepairVehicleEvent)

- **Null safety enforcement** - SaleEvents authorization bypass fixed
  - SaleListingActionEvent: Now requires manager AND listing to exist before execute()
  - ModifyListingPriceEvent: Now requires manager AND listing to exist before execute()
  - Price validation added (positive, < $100M)

- **FinanceDeal negative payment exploit fixed**
  - Custom payment amounts now enforce $100 minimum floor
  - Negative amounts rejected and logged

### Fixed
- **VehicleExtension crash bug** - Fixed `Vehicle.calculateSalePrice()` call that doesn't exist
  - Now stores original `getSellPrice` function reference before hooking
  - Properly retrieves base sell price for reliability modifier calculation
- **DEBUG flag disabled** - `UsedPlusCore.lua:19` now sets `DEBUG = false` for release
  - Reduces log verbosity significantly for players
  - Set to `true` only when developing/debugging
- **Removed obsolete TODO** - `main.lua` ESC menu integration comment updated
  - Finance Manager accessible via Shift+F hotkey (works great!)
  - ESC menu button deferred as low priority
- **Removed debug timestamp** - `UsedVehicleManager.lua` debug log cleaned up

### Security Pass #2 Fixes (Additional Hardening)
- **Stream drain logic fixed** - CRITICAL vulnerability patched
  - When array counts are invalid, stream data is now properly consumed
  - Previously, rejecting a count and setting it to 0 would leave stream pointer desynchronized
  - Affected: FinanceEvents, LeaseEvents, UsedPlusSettingsEvent
  - Malicious packets can no longer desync multiplayer sessions

- **Infinity value validation** - CRITICAL vulnerability patched
  - All NaN checks now also check for `math.huge` and `-math.huge`
  - Prevents creation of loans/payments with infinite values
  - Affected: FinanceEvents, RepairVehicleEvent, SaleEvents

- **Division by zero prevention** - Fixed in FinanceDeal:makePayment()
  - Now validates `monthlyPayment > 0` before calculating payment months
  - Prevents crash when deal has invalid configuration

- **Custom payment upper bound** - Fixed in FinanceDeal:setPaymentMode()
  - Custom payments now capped at max(payoffAmount, monthlyPayment * 10, $1M)
  - Prevents absurdly high values from being set

- **SaleListingActionEvent action type validation** - Added explicit enum check
  - Rejects unknown action types before processing
  - Prevents potential undefined behavior from invalid enum values

### RVB Integration Fix (OBD Scanner)
- **Fixed RVB detection in ModCompatibility.lua** - OBD Scanner now properly detects RVB failures
  - Previous detection only checked `g_currentMission.vehicleBreakdowns`
  - Now checks multiple RVB globals: `g_rvbMenu`, `g_vehicleBreakdownsDirectory`, `g_rvbPlayer`
  - Also checks specialization manager for "vehicleBreakdowns" registration
  - Debug logging shows which detection method succeeded

- **Enhanced RVB fault detection** - More robust part failure checking
  - Now checks `part.damaged` boolean in addition to `part.fault` string
  - Added `part.isFailed` check for compatibility with different RVB versions
  - Prefault detection now also checks `part.isWarning` boolean
  - Empty string `""` now treated same as `"empty"` and `nil` for no-fault state

### Steering Pull Malfunction Fix
- **Fixed steering pull not having any effect** - Now uses direct wheel physics manipulation
  - Previous approach: Modified `inputValue` in `setSteeringInput()` hook
  - Problem: FS25's internal input processing ignored/smoothed small input changes
  - Solution: New `applyDirectSteeringPull()` function directly sets `wheel.steeringAngle`
  - Uses `setWheelShapeProps()` to apply changes to physics engine (same as RVB)
  - Hydraulic surge, flat tire pull, and chronic steering degradation all now work
  - Pull effect scales with speed and condition severity
  - Pattern from: VehicleBreakdowns.lua `adjustSteeringAngle()`

### Notes
- Full code audit completed by 6 specialized OWASP security auditors
- Pass #1: 18 Critical/High severity vulnerabilities identified and fixed
- Pass #2: 2 Critical and 4 High severity issues fixed
- All stream desync vulnerabilities eliminated
- All numeric overflow/underflow vectors patched
- Ready for public multiplayer release

## [2.7.1] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Inspection Completion Popup** - When inspection finishes, a dialog pops up automatically!
  - "View Report" button opens the vehicle preview dialog immediately
  - "Later" button dismisses the popup; find the listing in Finances menu anytime
  - Also shows in-game notification as backup

- **Credit-Based Down Payment Requirements** - Better credit = access to lower down payments
  - Very Poor credit (<600): 25% minimum down required
  - Poor credit (600-649): 20% minimum down required
  - Fair credit (650-699): 10% minimum down required
  - Good credit (700-749): 5% minimum down required
  - Excellent credit (750+): 0% down available
  - Applies to vehicle financing, land financing, and repair financing
  - New players can no longer get 0% down loans without building credit first

### Fixed
- **`g_gui:showInfoDialog()` errors** - Replaced 21 invalid calls with `InfoDialog.show()`
  - Fixed TiresDialog locking when UYT not installed
  - Fixed NegotiationDialog "Make Offer" causing popup to lock
  - Fixed multiple other dialogs that could fail silently

  - Info-only mode shows status message (e.g., "Tank has Oil - Vehicle needs Hydraulic")
  - Pressing action when can't refill shows a warning message instead of doing nothing

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Delayed Inspection System** - Inspections now take game time instead of being instant!
  - **Three Inspection Tiers** with different costs, times, and data revealed:
    - **Quick Glance**: $1,000 + 2% (cap $2,500), 2 hours, overall rating only
    - **Standard**: $2,000 + 3% (cap $5,000), 6 hours, full reliability + parts
    - **Comprehensive**: $4,000 + 5% (cap $10,000), 12 hours, full details + DNA hint
  - Uses `HOUR_CHANGED` subscription - time scales with game speed
  - In-game notification when inspection completes
  - Progress display shows remaining hours

- **Listing Hold System** - Listings don't expire during inspection
  - `listingOnHold` flag prevents expiration while mechanic is working
  - Protects player's investment in the inspection fee

- **Credit-Gated Finance Terms** - Longer loan terms require better credit
  - Max vehicle finance term reduced from 20 to 15 years
  - 1-5 years: Any credit (300+)
  - 6-10 years: Fair credit (650+)
  - 11-15 years: Good credit (700+)
  - Term selector dynamically adjusts based on player's credit score

- **Shop Buy/Lease Override Toggle** - New setting for mod compatibility
  - `overrideShopBuyLease` setting in ESC > Settings > UsedPlus (default: ON)
  - When ON: Buy/Lease buttons open UnifiedPurchaseDialog (current behavior)
  - When OFF: Buy/Lease use vanilla behavior; use Finance button for UsedPlus features
  - Applies to both shop Buy/Lease AND farmland Buy on the map
  - Allows peaceful coexistence with other mods that also modify shop buttons

- **RVB Repair Override Toggle** - New setting for Real Vehicle Breakdowns users
  - `overrideRVBRepair` setting in ESC > Settings > UsedPlus (default: ON)
  - When ON: RVB's Repair button opens UsedPlus partial repair dialog
  - When OFF: RVB handles repair natively; use Map > "Repair Vehicle" for UsedPlus features
  - Only appears in settings when RVB is installed
  - Allows peaceful coexistence with other mods that also modify RVB

### Changed
- **Inspection fees significantly increased** (was $200 base + 1% capped at $2,000)
- **"Inspect" button now shows "Request Inspection"** when not yet inspected
- **"View Report" button** only appears after inspection is complete
- Preview dialog shows inspection state: Not Inspected → In Progress → Complete

### Fixed
- **FinanceDetailFrame payment buttons not working** - XML callbacks were misnamed
  - `onMakePayment()` → `onClickMakePayment()` (matches XML `onClick="onClickMakePayment"`)
  - `onEndLease()` → `onClickEndLease()` (matches XML `onClick="onClickEndLease"`)
- **DNA-based breakdown degradation not applied** - `applyBreakdownDegradation()` was defined but never called
  - Now called on engine overheat (Engine component)
  - Now called on hydraulic drop (Hydraulic component)
  - Now called on hitch failure (Hydraulic component)
  - Lemons (low DNA) now properly degrade faster on breakdowns
- **Repair event not updating vehicle reliability** - `onVehicleRepaired()` callback was orphaned
  - RepairVehicleEvent now calls `UsedPlusMaintenance.onVehicleRepaired()` after repairs
  - Lemon/Workhorse repair degradation now properly applied
- **Flat tire not cleared after repair** - `repairFlatTire()` was never called
  - TiresDialog: Tire replacement now clears flat tire state
  - FieldServiceKitDialog: OBD Scanner tire patch/plug now clears flat tire state
  - RepairVehicleEvent: Workshop repair now clears flat tire state
- **Fuel leak not fixed after repair** - `repairFuelLeak()` was orphaned
  - RepairVehicleEvent: Workshop engine repair now clears fuel leak
  - FieldServiceKitDialog: OBD Scanner engine diagnosis now clears fuel leak (good/perfect outcome)

### Technical
- New inspection fields on listing: `inspectionState`, `inspectionTier`, `inspectionRequestedAtHour`, `inspectionCompletesAtHour`, `inspectionFarmId`, `inspectionCostPaid`, `listingOnHold`
- `UsedVehicleManager.totalGameHours` tracks time for inspection completion
- `UsedVehicleManager:requestInspection()` - request inspection for a listing
- `UsedVehicleManager:processInspectionCompletions()` - called every game hour
- `UsedVehicleManager:getInspectionHoursRemaining()` - helper for UI
- `UsedPlusMaintenance.calculateInspectionCostForTier()` - tier cost calculation
- All inspection state persists to savegame
- Consolidated debug logging to use `UsedPlus.log*()` functions with single `UsedPlus.DEBUG` flag
- Removed dead code: `selectCollateralForAmount()`, `showSearchFailedDialog()`, legacy payment functions

---

## [2.6.3] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Shop buttons no longer intercept non-vehicle items** (seeds, fertilizers, consumables)
  - Buy button: Now checks `canFinanceItem()` before swapping callback; restores vanilla for items we don't handle
  - Lease button: Same pattern - only intercepts leaseable vehicles
  - Search Used button: Added $2,500 minimum price check to `canSearchItem()`
  - Previously: Clicking Buy on seeds did nothing (callback intercepted but no fallback)
  - Previously: Search Used appeared on seed pallets (they're StoreSpecies.VEHICLE in FS25)
  - Now: Seeds, fertilizers, and other cheap consumables use vanilla shop flow correctly

- **On-time payments now build credit for ALL UsedPlus financial products**
  - FinanceDeal.lua: Added PaymentTracker.recordPayment() for vehicle/land/cash loan payments
  - LeaseDeal.lua: Added PaymentTracker.recordPayment() for vehicle lease payments
  - LandLeaseDeal.lua: Added PaymentTracker.recordPayment() for land lease payments
  - Previously only vanilla bank loans and external API payments built credit history
  - Now all on-time payments contribute to credit score (was asymmetric: missed payments hurt, but on-time didn't help)

- **UYT tire wear now properly applied to purchased used vehicles**
  - Implemented delayed UYT tire wear application (750ms after spawn)
  - Previously tire wear was applied immediately during vehicle spawn, before UYT wheel data structures were ready
  - Now poor quality vehicles will show visually worn tires via UYT
  - Follows same pattern as delayed dirt application which was already working

### Changed
- Credit system now symmetric: on-time payments build credit just like missed payments hurt credit
- UYT tire initialization uses delayed timer pattern for reliability

---

## [2.6.2] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **DNA-Driven Seller Behavior** - Sellers now KNOW what they have!
  - Vehicle DNA (workhorseLemonScale) DETERMINES seller personality, not random
  - DNA 0.00-0.20 → desperate (lemon sellers want to unload)
  - DNA 0.20-0.40 → motivated (seller suspects issues)
  - DNA 0.40-0.60 → reasonable (seller doesn't know either way)
  - DNA 0.60-0.80 → firm (seller knows it runs well)
  - DNA 0.80-1.00 → **immovable** (workhorse sellers WON'T NEGOTIATE)
- **New "Immovable" Seller Personality** - For workhorses (DNA 0.80+)
  - Only accepts offers at 98%+ of asking price
  - Will NOT counter - just rejects and holds firm
  - 90% walk-away chance on any lowball (even 95%)
  - Weather modifiers still work but can't overcome immovable sellers
- **Permanent Walk-Away Mechanic** - Insulted sellers = lost sales
  - New "walkaway" response type when seller is insulted
  - Listing is PERMANENTLY removed from search - cannot be accessed again
  - Walk-away chance varies by personality: desperate 5%, motivated 15%, reasonable 35%, firm 60%, immovable 90%
  - Shows special dialog: "Your offer insulted the seller. This vehicle is no longer available."
- Translation keys for walkaway messages (usedplus_walkaway_title, usedplus_walkaway_message)
- Translation keys for disabled modes (usedplus_mode_finance_disabled, etc.)
- **Cross-Mod Integration Settings** - All 6 compatible mod integrations now have failsafe toggles
  - Settings appear in ESC > Settings > Game Settings > Mod Compatibility
  - Toggles only show if the corresponding mod is detected
  - **RVB Integration** (enableRVBIntegration) - Toggle Real Vehicle Breakdowns integration
  - **UYT Integration** (enableUYTIntegration) - Toggle Use Your Tyres integration
  - **AM Integration** (enableAMIntegration) - Toggle AdvancedMaintenance engine damage chaining
  - **HP Integration** (enableHPIntegration) - Toggle HirePurchasing (shows/hides Finance button)
  - **BUE Integration** (enableBUEIntegration) - Toggle BuyUsedEquipment (shows/hides Search button)
  - **ELS Integration** (enableELSIntegration) - Toggle EnhancedLoanSystem (enables/disables loans)
  - Disabling integration = UsedPlus behaves as if that mod isn't installed
  - Comprehensive documentation added to ModCompatibility.lua header

### Fixed
- **Walk Away button not closing dialog** - Used deferred close pattern like Complete Purchase
- **OBD Scanner buttons not working** - Typo: `UsedPlus.logInfoDebug()` → `UsedPlus.logDebug()`
- **Purchase dialogs not honoring Settings toggles** - Finance/Lease mode validation
  - UnifiedPurchaseDialog now checks `UsedPlusSettings:isSystemEnabled("Finance")` and `isSystemEnabled("Lease")`
  - UnifiedLandPurchaseDialog now checks the same settings
  - Mode selector shows "(Disabled)" text when system is turned off
  - Attempting to switch to disabled mode shows info dialog and reverts to Cash
- **Base Search Success % setting not working** - UsedVehicleSearch.lua:421 used old setting name `searchSuccessPercent` instead of renamed `baseSearchSuccessPercent`. Slider now actually affects search success rates.
- **enableRepairSystem master toggle not enforced** - Complete settings audit and fix
  - VehicleSellingPointExtension: Added guard in repair/repaint dialog interception (2 locations)
  - RepairDialog.setVehicle(): Added master toggle check
  - RepairFinanceDialog.setData(): Added master toggle check
  - RVBWorkshopIntegration: Added guards in hookRepairButton, injectRepaintButton, click handlers
- **enableVehicleSaleSystem only checked in 1 of 4 entry points**
  - InGameMenuVehiclesFrameExtension.onClickSellOverride(): Added setting check with vanilla fallback
  - VehicleSellingPointExtension SellItemDialog intercept: Added setting check
  - WorkshopScreenExtension.hookSellButton(): Added setting check in callback
- **baseTradeInPercent setting not used** - All trade-in calculations were hardcoded to 50-65%
  - UnifiedPurchaseDialog.getCreditTradeInMultiplier(): Now uses setting as base + credit bonus
  - SellVehicleDialog.updateComparisonDisplay(): Now uses setting for range display
  - SaleListingDetailsDialog: Trade-in estimate now uses setting
- **Finance/Lease events missing setting validation** - Multiplayer exploit fix
  - FinanceVehicleEvent.execute(): Validates enableFinanceSystem before processing
  - TakeLoanEvent.execute(): Validates enableFinanceSystem before processing
  - LeaseVehicleEvent:run(): Validates enableLeaseSystem before processing
- **enableCreditSystem didn't bypass credit checks** - canFinance() still rejected low credit when disabled
  - CreditScore.canFinance(): Now returns true immediately when credit system is disabled

### Changed
- Weather still influences negotiation (preserved from v2.6.0)
- UsedVehicleManager now derives personality from DNA when creating listings

---

## [2.6.1] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Graduated rejection risk for negotiation** - Lowballing now has real consequences!
  - 0-5% below threshold: Always counter (safe)
  - 5-10% below: Usually counter, 0-30% reject chance (low risk)
  - 10-15% below: 50/50 counter vs reject (medium risk)
  - 15-20% below: Usually reject, 0-30% counter chance (high risk)
  - >20% below: Always reject - insulting offer! (extreme risk)
- **Personality tolerance modifiers** - Sellers react differently to lowballs
  - Desperate: +8% tolerance (forgiving)
  - Motivated: +4% tolerance
  - Reasonable: 0% (baseline)
  - Firm: -5% tolerance (easily insulted)
- Cash validation for used vehicle purchases
  - Checks in NegotiationDialog:onClickSendOffer() before submitting
  - Checks in SellerResponseDialog:onClickPrimary() before completing purchase
  - Shows clear error with shortfall amount and current balance

### Fixed
- **SellerResponseDialog $0 price bug** - Counter offer popup showed "Your Offer: $0"
  - Root cause 1: SellerResponseDialog used custom `getInstance()` pattern instead of DialogLoader
  - Root cause 2: `setTextColorByName()` doesn't exist in FS25 - crashes before display
  - Fix: Converted to DialogLoader pattern, replaced all `setTextColorByName()` with `setTextColor(r,g,b,a)`
- **Dialog not closing after Complete Purchase** - Deferred callback to next frame
- Converted NegotiationDialog to DialogLoader pattern
- Widened counter offer dialog (+100px) - 600px → 700px to fit 3 buttons

### Changed
- Accept mode buttons - Only shows "Complete Purchase", no Cancel (deal is done)
- Registered both dialogs in DialogLoader.registerAll()
