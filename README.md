# UsedPlus - Transform Your Farm Into a Real Business

**Stop playing with Monopoly money.** Start making real financial decisions.

> **Version 2.6.3** | **FS25 Compatible** | **Multiplayer Supported**

## The Problem With Vanilla FS25

You see that $450,000 combine in the shop. Can you afford it? In vanilla FS25, that's the only question. **Yes or no. Buy or don't.**

But real farmers don't work that way. They finance. They lease. They trade in old equipment. They build credit. They negotiate. They make *smart financial decisions* that let them grow faster while managing risk.

**UsedPlus brings all of that to Farming Simulator 25.**

---

## Core Features

### Credit Scoring (300-850)

Your financial history affects everything. UsedPlus introduces a real FICO-style credit system:

| Credit Rating | Score | Interest Impact |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| Excellent | 750+ | -1.5% rate |
| Good | 700-749 | -0.5% rate |
| Fair | 650-699 | +0.5% rate |
| Poor | 600-649 | +1.5% rate |
| Very Poor | <600 | +3.0% rate |

**Build credit the real way:**
- On-time payments: +5 points
- Pay off loans early: +50 points
- Miss a payment: -25 points

---

### Vehicle & Equipment Financing

That $450,000 combine? Now you have options:

- **Cash** - Pay full price
- **Finance** - 1-15 year terms (credit-gated), 0-50% down payment
- **Lease** - Lower monthly payments, balloon payment at end

**Longer terms require better credit:**
- 1-5 years: Any credit
- 6-10 years: Fair credit (650+)
- 11-15 years: Good credit (700+)

All modes available from a **single unified dialog**. Select your mode, adjust terms, see payments update in real-time.

---

### Used Equipment Marketplace

Why pay full price? Hunt for deals with the 3-tier agent system:

| Agent | Fee | Time | Success Rate | Typical Discount |
|-------|-----|------|--------------|------------------|
| Local | 2% | 1-2 months | 85% | 25-40% off |
| Regional | 4% | 2-4 months | 90% | 15-30% off |
| National | 6% | 3-6 months | 95% | 5-20% off |

Used equipment comes with history - damage, wear, hours. That "great deal" might need $15,000 in repairs.

> **Note:** Search is available for vehicles and implements worth $2,500+. Consumables like seeds and fertilizers use the standard shop flow.

---

### Price Negotiation

Found a used tractor? **Don't just pay asking price - negotiate.**

**Seller Personalities:**
- **Desperate** - Will accept 75%+ offers easily
- **Motivated** - Room to negotiate
- **Reasonable** - Standard negotiation
- **Firm** - Don't lowball!
- **Immovable** - Workhorse owners. 98%+ only.

**The Risk of Lowballing:**

| Gap Below Threshold | Risk Level | Result |
|---------------------|------------|--------|
| Within 5% | Safe | Always counter |
| 5-10% below | Low | Usually counter |
| 10-15% below | Medium | 50/50 |
| 15-20% below | High | Usually reject |
| >20% below | Insulted | **Permanent walk-away!** |

**Mechanic's Whisper** - Before you offer, your mechanic hints at the seller's psychology. *"They seem pretty eager to sell..."* means go low.

**Weather Affects Deals** - Storms make sellers anxious. Wait for bad weather to negotiate:
- Hail: +12% acceptance
- Storm: +8% acceptance
- Rain/Snow: +5% acceptance

---

### Sell Smart, Not Fast

Vanilla instant-sell gives you pennies on the dollar. UsedPlus replaces it with realistic agent-based sales:

| Method | Return | Time |
|--------|--------|------|
| Trade-In | 50-65% | Instant |
| Local Agent | 60-75% | 1-2 months |
| Regional Agent | 75-90% | 2-4 months |
| National Agent | 90-100% | 3-6 months |

When a buyer is found, you get an offer notification. Accept or wait for better.

---

### Land Leasing

Can't afford a field? **Lease it.**

- 1, 3, 5, or 10-year terms
- Longer leases = lower annual costs
- **Buyout option** - Convert lease to ownership with progress-based discount
- **Warning:** 3 missed payments = land seizure + credit damage

---

### Configurable Payments

Not every month is a good month:

| Payment Mode | Effect | Credit Impact |
|--------------|--------|---------------|
| Skip | Balance grows | -25 points |
| Minimum | Interest only | Neutral |
| Standard | Normal payment | +5 points |
| Extra (2x) | Pay off faster | +5 points |
| Custom | You decide | Varies |

**Negative amortization is real.** Skip payments and your balance grows.

---

### Partial Repair & Repaint

Why fully repair a tractor you're selling next month?

- **Quick buttons:** 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- **Real-time cost preview**
- **Finance option** - Spread repair costs over time
- **Separate dialogs** - Fix engine without touching paint

---

### Workhorse/Lemon DNA

Every vehicle has hidden DNA (0.0-1.0) that determines its fate:

| DNA Range | Type | Long-Term Effect |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| 0.0-0.29 | **Lemon** | Repairs make it worse. Death spiral. |
| 0.30-0.69 | Average | Normal degradation |
| 0.70-0.89 | **Workhorse** | Minimal degradation |
| 0.90-1.00 | **Legendary** | IMMUNE to repair degradation |

Legendary workhorses can last *forever* with proper maintenance. Lemons spiral into money pits.

**Mechanic inspection hints:**
- *"I'd burn some sage before driving this one..."* = Lemon
- *"About what you'd expect from the factory"* = Average
- *"In 30 years, I've seen maybe a dozen this well built"* = Legendary

---

### Hydraulic Malfunctions

Real hydraulic system failures:

| Malfunction | Trigger | Effect |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Runaway Engine | Oil AND hydraulic <10% | Speed 150%, brakes 40% |
| Implement Stuck | Hydraulic <25% | Can't raise/lower |
| Hydraulic Surge | Hydraulic <60% | Sudden steering pull |
| Implement Drag | Hydraulic <35% | Max speed 60% |

**The Runaway Engine** is the signature failure. Neglect fluids and your tractor accelerates uncontrollably with barely working brakes.

## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn't "Search Used" appear for seeds/fertilizers?**
A: UsedPlus only offers used search for vehicles and implements worth $2,500+. Seeds, fertilizers, and other consumables use the standard vanilla shop flow.

**Q: Why can't I select a 15-year term?**
A: Longer finance terms require better credit. 1-5 years is available to everyone, 6-10 years requires 650+ credit, and 11-15 years requires 700+ credit. Build your credit score by making on-time payments.

**Q: Why won't the seller negotiate on this workhorse?**
A: Sellers *know what they have*. Workhorse owners (DNA 0.80+) are "immovable" - they'll only accept 98%+ of asking price.

**Q: I offered 70% and the seller walked away. Is the listing gone?**
A: Yes. Insulting offers (>20% below threshold) cause permanent walk-away. That listing is removed forever.

**Q: How do I know if a vehicle is a lemon or workhorse?**
A: The mechanic's inspection gives hints through quotes. Seller personality is also a clue - desperate sellers often have lemons.

**Q: Why can't I finance this cheap implement?**
A: Minimum financing amount is $2,500. Banks don't process loans for trivially small amounts.

**Q: Can I adjust paint repair costs?**
A: Yes! Go to ESC > Settings > UsedPlus and adjust the Paint Cost Multiplier (0.25x to 2.0x).

**Q: Does this work in multiplayer?**
A: Yes. All features work in multiplayer with proper synchronization.

**Q: I have another mod that also changes the shop Buy button. How do I fix conflicts?**
A: Go to ESC > Settings > UsedPlus and disable "Override Shop Buy/Lease". UsedPlus will stop intercepting the Buy/Lease buttons. Use the "Finance" button instead to access UsedPlus features (you can switch to Cash mode inside our dialog).

### For Mod Developers

UsedPlus provides a public API:

```lua
if UsedPlusAPI and UsedPlusAPI.isReady() then
    local score = UsedPlusAPI.getCreditScore(farmId)        -- 300-850
    local dna = UsedPlusAPI.getVehicleDNA(vehicle)          -- 0.0-1.0
    local canFinance = UsedPlusAPI.canFinance(farmId, "VEHICLE_FINANCE")
end
```

Register external loans with our credit bureau:

```lua
local externalId = UsedPlusAPI.registerExternalDeal("MyMod", loanId, farmId, {
    dealType = "loan",
    originalAmount = 50000,
    monthlyPayment = 2500,
})
UsedPlusAPI.reportExternalPayment(externalId, 2500)  -- Builds credit!
```
