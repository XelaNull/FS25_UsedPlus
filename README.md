## What Is UsedPlus?

UsedPlus brings **real financial consequences** to Farming Simulator 25. This isn't "feature soup" - it's an **interconnected economic simulation** where your decisions ripple across systems.

In vanilla FS25, every purchase is the same question: *Can I afford it?* Click buy. Done.

**UsedPlus asks different questions:**
- Should I finance this tractor over 10 years or save up cash?
- Is that "great deal" actually a lemon?
- Will my credit score let me expand this season?
- Should I wait for a storm to negotiate a better price?

## 🌟 What Makes This Different

### Everything Connects

| System | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| **Credit Score** | Interest rates, loan terms, lease eligibility, trade-in values |
| **Vehicle DNA** | Long-term reliability, seller personality, repair outcomes, RVB integration |
| **Payment History** | Credit score (+5 per payment, -25 per miss), repossession risk |
| **Weather** | Negotiation success (Hail +12%, Storm +8%, Rain +5%) |
| **Maintenance** | 15+ specific malfunctions, runaway engines, system failures |

**[Learn How Systems Interact →](https://github.com/XelaNull/FS25_UsedPlus/wiki)**

### Your Vehicles Have Stories

Ever find yourself making up backstories for your equipment? With UsedPlus, you don't have to imagine - the stories emerge naturally:

> *"That old Fendt? 80,000 hours and still runs like new. I'll never sell her."*

> *"Got a 'great deal' from a desperate seller. Now I know why he was desperate."*

> *"Waited for a thunderstorm to close the deal. Saved me $40,000."*

> *"The mechanic warned me. Said something about burning sage. I should have listened."*

Every vehicle has hidden DNA. Some become legends. Some become money pits. The mechanic gives you hints, the seller's behavior tells a story, and over hundreds of hours, you'll develop genuine attachment to the machines that earn it.

## 🤝 Companion Mods

UsedPlus **deeply integrates** with these mods to create a unified experience:

### 🔧 Real Vehicle Breakdowns (RVB)

**Integration Level: DEEP** — UsedPlus and RVB coordinate to create a layered failure system.

| What RVB Does | How UsedPlus Enhances |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Hard failures (parts break completely) | Symptoms first (misfires, overheating) before RVB hard failure |
| Part-based tracking (starter, generator, etc.) | DNA affects RVB part lifetimes (0.6x-1.4x multiplier) |
| Visual damage | OBD Scanner shows both UsedPlus + RVB health in one view |
| Repair workshops | Partial repair option coordinates with RVB part states |

**Why Use Both:** RVB provides the mechanical depth, UsedPlus provides the economic consequences. Lemons break RVB parts faster. Workhorses extend RVB part life. The OBD Scanner becomes your essential tool showing both systems together.

**[Deep Dive: RVB Integration →](https://github.com/XelaNull/FS25_UsedPlus/wiki/RVB-Integration)**

### 🛞 Use Up Your Tyres (UYT)

**Integration Level: DEEP** — Tire wear, quality, and DNA create emergent long-term strategy.

| What UYT Does | How UsedPlus Enhances |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Tire wear % per wheel (distance based) | DNA affects wear rate (lemons 1.4x, workhorses 0.6x) |
| Visual deterioration | Quality tier affects UYT wear (Quality tires wear 33% slower) |
| Per-wheel tracking (FL, FR, RL, RR) | Flat tire probability scales with UYT wear % |
| Replacement based on wear | OBD Scanner displays UYT wear with color-coded warnings |

**Why Use Both:** Quality tires on a workhorse = 2,500 hour lifespan. Retread tires on a lemon = 350 hours. The math changes your purchasing decisions. Used vehicles come with realistic tire wear. The OBD Scanner shows you exactly which tires need replacement.

**[Deep Dive: UYT Integration →](https://github.com/XelaNull/FS25_UsedPlus/wiki/UYT-Integration)**

> 💡 **Tip:** Both RVB and UYT are optional but highly recommended. UsedPlus works standalone, but the combination creates the most immersive economic simulation.

## 🤖 100% AI-Written

This mod was written **entirely by AI**. Not a single line of code was written by a human - only reviewed.

Every function, every dialog, every network event, every XML layout - all generated by **Claude** (developer) with UX review by **Samantha** (co-creator) through Anthropic's Claude Code.

- **~65,000 lines of code**
- **113 Lua files + 60 XML files**
- **38 custom dialogs**
- **1,944 localization keys** translated to 27 languages
- **3 months development** (November 2025 - January 2026)

We believe this is one of the most ambitious AI-human collaborative software projects released to the public for FS25.

## 🔌 Compatible Mods

UsedPlus **plays nice** with these financial and marketplace mods through feature deferral:

| Mod | How It Works Together |
|-----|----------------------|
| 💰 **[EnhancedLoanSystem](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=314906&title=fs2025)** | ELS handles general cash loans, UsedPlus handles purchase financing. Finance Manager shows both. |
| 📋 **[HirePurchasing](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=327821&title=fs2025)** | HP handles its financing system, UsedPlus hides duplicate buttons. Finance Manager shows HP + UsedPlus leases together. |
| 🛒 **[BuyUsedEquipment](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=312631&title=fs2025)** | BUE handles used marketplace, UsedPlus defers (hides Search button). Use BUE to find, UsedPlus to finance/maintain. |

**Integration Strategy:** When UsedPlus detects these mods, it automatically hides overlapping features to prevent conflicts. You get the best of both worlds - use each mod for what it does best.

> 💡 **Tip:** Load order doesn't matter. UsedPlus detects these mods at runtime and adjusts behavior automatically.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why doesn't "Search Used" appear?**
> Only available for items worth $10,000+. Small tools use standard shop.

**Why can't I select a 15-year term?**
> Long terms require good credit. 15 years needs 700+ credit score.

**Why won't the seller negotiate?**
> Sellers with great equipment (workhorses) are "immovable" - they know what they have.

**I offered 70% and the seller walked away permanently. What happened?**
> Offers >20% below threshold trigger permanent walk-away. That listing is gone forever.

**How do I know if a vehicle is a lemon?**
> Get a mechanic inspection. Listen for phrases like "burn some sage" or "gremlins."

## 👨‍💻 For Mod Developers

UsedPlus provides a public API for integration:

```lua
if UsedPlusAPI and UsedPlusAPI.isReady() then
    local score = UsedPlusAPI.getCreditScore(farmId)        -- 300-850
    local dna = UsedPlusAPI.getVehicleDNA(vehicle)          -- 0.0-1.0
    local canFinance = UsedPlusAPI.canFinance(farmId, "VEHICLE_FINANCE")
end
```

Register external loans to build player credit:

```lua
local externalId = UsedPlusAPI.registerExternalDeal("MyMod", loanId, farmId, {
    dealType = "loan",
    originalAmount = 50000,
    monthlyPayment = 2500,
})
UsedPlusAPI.reportExternalPayment(externalId, 2500)  -- Builds credit!
```
