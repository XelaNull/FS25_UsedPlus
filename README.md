## Why UsedPlus?

You see that $450,000 combine in the shop. In vanilla FS25, one question: **Can you afford it?**

But real farmers don't work that way. They finance. They lease. They trade in old equipment. They build credit. They negotiate.

**UsedPlus brings all of that to Farming Simulator 25.**

## Deep Dive

### Credit Scoring (300-850)

Your financial history affects interest rates and available terms.

| Rating | Score | Interest Impact |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Excellent | 750+ | -1.5% |
| Good | 700-749 | -0.5% |
| Fair | 650-699 | +0.5% |
| Poor | 600-649 | +1.5% |
| Very Poor | <600 | +3.0% |

**Building Credit:**
- On-time payment: **+5 points**
- Pay off loan early: **+50 points**
- Miss a payment: **-25 points**

---

### Financing & Leasing

**Finance Terms by Credit:**

| Term Length | Required Credit |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1-5 years | Any |
| 6-10 years | 650+ (Fair) |
| 11-15 years | 700+ (Good) |

**Leasing** offers lower monthly payments with a balloon payment at the end. Great for equipment you might upgrade soon.

All modes available from a single unified dialog - select mode, adjust terms, see payments update in real-time.

---

### Used Marketplace

Find deals through the 3-tier agent system:

| Agent | Fee | Search Time | Success Rate | Typical Discount |
|-------|-----|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Local | 2% | 1-2 months | 85% | 25-40% off |
| Regional | 4% | 2-4 months | 90% | 15-30% off |
| National | 6% | 3-6 months | 95% | 5-20% off |

Used equipment comes with history - damage, wear, operating hours. That "great deal" might need $15,000 in repairs. **Get an inspection before buying.**

> Available for vehicles and implements worth **$10,000+**

---

### Negotiation System

Found used equipment? **Don't pay asking price - negotiate.**

**Seller Personalities (DNA-driven!):**

| Type | Accepts | How to Spot |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Desperate | 75%+ | *"They seem eager to sell..."* |
| Motivated | 80%+ | Room to negotiate |
| Reasonable | 85%+ | Standard negotiation |
| Firm | 92%+ | Don't lowball |
| Immovable | 98%+ | Workhorse owners - they know what they have |

> **Pro tip:** Seller personality is tied to vehicle DNA. Great deals from desperate sellers are often lemons. Stubborn sellers often have workhorses worth the premium!

**The Risk of Lowballing:**

| Gap Below Threshold | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| Within 5% | Always counter |
| 5-10% below | Usually counter |
| 10-15% below | 50/50 |
| 15-20% below | Usually reject |
| >20% below | **Permanent walk-away!** |

**Weather Affects Deals:** Storms make sellers anxious.
- Hail: +12% acceptance
- Storm: +8% acceptance
- Rain/Snow: +5% acceptance

---

### Selling Your Equipment

Vanilla instant-sell gives you pennies. UsedPlus offers realistic agent-based sales:

| Method | Return | Time |
|--------|--------|------|
| Trade-In | 50-65% | Instant |
| Local Agent | 60-75% | 1-2 months |
| Regional Agent | 75-90% | 2-4 months |
| National Agent | 90-100% | 3-6 months |

When a buyer is found, you receive an offer notification. Accept or wait for better.

---

### Land Leasing

Can't afford a field? **Lease it.**

- **Terms:** 1, 3, 5, or 10 years (longer = cheaper)
- **Buyout Option:** Convert to ownership with progress-based discount
- **Warning:** 3 missed payments = seizure + credit damage

---

### Payment Options

Not every month is a good month.

| Mode | Effect | Credit Impact |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Skip | Balance grows | -25 points |
| Minimum | Interest only | Neutral |
| Standard | Normal payment | +5 points |
| Extra (2x) | Pay faster | +5 points |
| Custom | You decide | Varies |

**Negative amortization is real.** Skip payments and your balance grows.

---

### Repair & Repaint

Why fully repair a tractor you're selling?

- **Quick buttons:** 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- **Real-time cost preview**
- **Finance repairs** - spread costs over time
- **Separate dialogs** - fix engine without touching paint

---

### Vehicle DNA (Workhorses & Lemons)

Every vehicle has hidden DNA (0.0-1.0) determining long-term reliability:

| DNA | Type | Effect |
|-----|------|--------|
| 0.0-0.29 | **Lemon** | Repairs make it worse. Death spiral. |
| 0.30-0.69 | Average | Normal degradation |
| 0.70-0.89 | **Workhorse** | Minimal degradation |
| 0.90-1.00 | **Legendary** | IMMUNE to repair degradation |

**Mechanic inspection hints:**
- *"I'd burn some sage before driving this one..."* = Lemon
- *"About what you'd expect from the factory"* = Average
- *"In 30 years, I've seen maybe a dozen this well built"* = Legendary

---

### Hydraulic Malfunctions

Real hydraulic failures from neglected maintenance:

| Malfunction | Trigger | Effect |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Runaway Engine | Oil AND hydraulic <10% | Speed 150%, brakes 40% |
| Implement Stuck | Hydraulic <25% | Can't raise/lower |
| Hydraulic Surge | Hydraulic <60% | Sudden steering pull |
| Implement Drag | Hydraulic <35% | Max speed 60% |

**Runaway Engine** is the signature failure. Neglect fluids and your tractor accelerates uncontrollably with barely working brakes.

## FAQ

**Why doesn't "Search Used" appear?**
> Only available for vehicles/implements worth $10,000+. Consumables use standard shop.

**Why can't I select a 15-year term?**
> Longer terms require better credit. Build your score with on-time payments.

**Why won't the seller negotiate?**
> Workhorse owners (DNA 0.80+) are "immovable" - they know what they have.

**I offered 70% and the seller walked away permanently. What happened?**
> Insulting offers (>20% below threshold) cause permanent walk-away. That listing is gone.

**How do I know if a vehicle is a lemon?**
> Mechanic inspection gives hints. Desperate sellers often have lemons.

**Does this work in multiplayer?**
> Yes, all features work with proper synchronization.

**Another mod conflicts with Buy button. Help?**
> Disable "Override Shop Buy/Lease" in Settings. Use the "Finance" button instead.

**RVB's Repair button conflicts with another mod. Help?**
> Disable "Override RVB Repair" in Settings. Use Map > "Repair Vehicle" for UsedPlus partial repair instead.
