**Subject:** Question about posting a free modding resource

---

Hi mods -

I wanted to reach out before posting because I think what I'd like to share might ride the line on self-promotion rules, and I'd rather ask first than assume.

I've been working on my first FS25 mod using Claude Code (Opus 4.5) as my coding partner. Along the way I had Claude document everything we learned - how to create custom dialogs, network events for multiplayer, common pitfalls (stuff that doesn't work), patterns from analyzing 164+ community mods, etc. Ended up with about 27 doc files and 9,000+ lines of notes.

The thing is, I'm sharing something I created myself, which could be seen as self-promotion. That's not my intent - I just want to share something that might help other modders. But I get how it might look from the outside, so I wanted to check first.

Here's what I'm hoping to share:
- The coding reference: https://github.com/XelaNull/FS25_UsedPlus/tree/master/FS25_AI_Coding_Reference
- My draft post: https://github.com/XelaNull/FS25_UsedPlus/blob/master/FS25_AI_Coding_Reference/REDDIT.md

The post also links to two other community resources I found while researching (FS25 Community LUADOC and FS25-lua-scripting). Trying to keep a humble tone since it's my first mod and first post in the community.

Would this kind of post be ok? If not, I would appreciate any suggestions on how I could restructure it, or where else might be a better place to share? Happy to adjust whatever you suggest.

Thank you for your time
