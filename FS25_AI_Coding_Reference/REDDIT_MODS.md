## Message

**Subject:** Question about posting a free modding resource

**Body:**

Hi mods,

I wanted to reach out before posting because I think what I'd like to share might ride the line on self-promotion rules, and I'd rather ask first than assume.

**What I created:**

I've been learning FS25 modding (working on a mod that's still in development) and along the way I documented everything I learned into a free coding reference for other modders. It covers things like:

- How to create custom dialogs (the GUI system is tricky)
- Network events for multiplayer
- Common pitfalls (17 things that don't work, like `os.time()` being unavailable)
- Patterns extracted from analyzing 164+ community mods

It's about 27 documentation files / 9,300+ lines, completely free, hosted on GitHub.

**Why I'm asking:**

The resource lives in my mod's GitHub repository (the mod itself isn't released yet - still in development). So linking to the docs could be seen as promoting my unreleased mod. That's not my intent - the coding reference is a standalone resource that would be useful to any FS25 modder regardless of whether they ever use my mod. But I understand if it looks like self-promotion from the outside.

**What I'd like to do:**

Post a text post sharing the resource with the community, including:
- What's covered (dialogs, events, managers, pitfalls, etc.)
- Links to two other complementary community resources I discovered
- The GitHub link to the documentation

**My questions:**

1. Would this kind of post be allowed under your rules?
2. If not, is there a way I could restructure it to be acceptable?
3. If it's not appropriate for r/farmingsimulator, do you have suggestions for where else I might share it? (A modding-specific subreddit, Discord, etc.)

I'm happy to adjust whatever you suggest. I just want to share something useful with the community without stepping on any rules.

Thanks for your time, and thanks for keeping the subreddit running!

## If They Say Yes

Great! Use the post draft in `REDDIT.md`

## If They Say No

Ask for their suggestions on where to post. Possible alternatives:
- FS modding Discords
- GIANTS Developer Network forums
- FS-specific modding subreddits (if any exist)
- General gamedev/modding subreddits

## If They Don't Respond (after ~1 week)

Options:
1. Send a polite follow-up
2. Post anyway with a very conservative approach (focus entirely on the resource, minimal mention of your mod)
3. Try the GIANTS forums instead

## Notes

- Mods are volunteers - be patient and grateful
- If they have conditions (like "don't mention your mod name"), agree graciously
- This approach shows respect for the community and makes you look good regardless of outcome
- Even if they say no, you've made a positive impression
